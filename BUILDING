Although this is an opensource project, it's not a project I have gone out of my way to make easy to build for anyone and everyone (no maven, etc). I don't like much and don't use it unless other people working with me are using it. Eventually I will probably use SBT.

However, for anyone that does wish to build it, here are some tips:

1) Scala 2.11 is required. Yes, there is a Java branch if you want to build that instead. However, I don't support it anymore and you're on your own for building it. If you have questions about building the Scala version and your first question isn't "How do I build this for Eclipse", then feel free to ask :)
2) If you are having troubles with your IDE of choice, use Intellij IDEA (the stable version). That is what I use and I cannot offer IDE specific help otherwise. Will it build in Android Studio? Maybe, I don't know and don't care to find out really.
3) You must target Java 7, not Java 6 because I used a few Java 7 features that will work on Android. If you wish to use 6, then you would have to change those things. I personally do not like Java circa 2006, so I use whatever I can to make it a palatable language in personal projects.
4) The following dependencies are needed (all jars are under library directory):
scala-async.jar - For async stuff
android-support-v4.jar - For actionbarsherlock and other things.
actionbarsherlock - https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock. It's already included in the project itself as a seperate directory, you just have to import the directory as a module dependency in intellij idea (or whatever is equiviliant dependency in your IDE of choice)
Google Play Services - (unless you remove the xml bits for this in the MainActivities' XML)
cwac-loaderex - Currently for SharedPreferencesLoader, but eventually for SQLite as well.
Jetbrain's Annotations for Nullability and Internalization - makes these things easier to deal with.

Following all that, it should build.
