    <string name="noSupportDialogTitle">Device Locked</string>

    <string name="noAdditionalSettingSupport"><![CDATA[Your device manufacturer (probably Samsung) decided to lock down your device model beyond what Google recommends by default. Unfortunately that means I cannot include access to the network settings shortcut for users without root and rooted devices with SELinux restrictions. \n\nSome rooted devices (probably Samsung once again) running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or later are additionally locked out due to SELinux restrictions that cannot be bypassed without a custom or modified kernel. For example, if other rooted apps work on your device, but you cannot access this shortcut in my app, then your device is locked down by an SELinux policy that won\'t let non-system apps (like mine) launch system app activities such as the network settings shortcut. \n\nI do not currently own any Samsung devices and cannot help you directly with rooting. Instead, please find your device\'s forum on xda-developers.com for more information. \n\nIf functionality like switching the network type is important to you, I would recommend not buying devices from this manufacturer in the future, no matter how nice their devices might be.]]>
