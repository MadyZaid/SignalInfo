Gives you all the available information for the CMDA/GSM/LTE Signal on your
Android Device. Not all information may be available depending on the OEM/OS
version of the device.

I do accept pull requests if you ask nicely. Also translations to other languages
are welcomed if you want to commit the files to me replacing the strings. All
strings for the user interface are abstracted out of the design, so easy to change.
