Conversion of my SignalInfo app to Scala. I don't consider all of the code to
be entirely "idiomatic Scala" due to performance considerations on Android
and also time needed to refine the code to be less "Java like."

However, the code is still more concise and I give some examples of how to cut down
on some of the Java noise by using techniques such as implicits for anonymous Java methods:

    implicit def pageChangeLambda(funct: (Int) => Unit) = new ViewPager.SimpleOnPageChangeListener {
        override def onPageSelected(position: Int): Unit = funct
    }

    // usage below:

    mViewPager.setOnPageChangeListener {
        (position: Int) => actionBar.setSelectedNavigationItem(position)
    }
